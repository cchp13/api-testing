This folder would contain testing files that verify that testing utilities remain functional. As an example, `test_pytest_reporting.py` serves to check that test outcome is properly captured by pytest and pytest-html, discarding systemic misreporting as a consequence of the tool conveying test results being flawed.

As a CI consideration, these tests are not intended to run on every PR, but ideally they would be run on every machine used for automated testing before each release is approved.
